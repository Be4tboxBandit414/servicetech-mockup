      An initial inspection allows our factory trained personnel to diagnose the internal and external condition of the cooling towers. Our inspection includes all internal components such as the fill media, drift eliminators, distribution system, sealant condition
      and the collector grid. The external components will include the fans, fan motors, sump screens and other pertinent equipment.
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-3">
      We have a vast knowledge of the cooling tower industry and the engineering side of maintenance as well. This means making repairs to collector grids, headers, distribution systems, fans, motors, and sealant.
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-3">
      Like any other machinery, cooling towers are more energy and cost efficient when they are properly maintained. Not many of us would drive our cars for 100,000 miles without changing the oil, not to mention other routine maintenance involved with an automobile.
      The cleaning of the cooling towers we maintain is the foundation of our business passion and quality.
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-3">
      We understand that circumstances occasionally call for additional cooling capacity to be added to your cooling loop, or towers have deteriorated to the point they need to be replaced. Whether it is a new site or addtional equipment added, our New Tower
      Division is able to size, design and add new towers to your site.
